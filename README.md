We chose to create an event booking website for our final project. Miami has events constantly happening on any given day, and we thought it would be cool to design a website where you could post events, and people could attend. You are able to register, log in, browse through the different events being hosted on the site,and reserve tickets for those events.
The events show up in your reservations page. You are also able to change your password, name, or email. There is also functionality for an admin. You can register as an admin using an admin code provided to you by any of us. When you log in as an admin, you are able to see how many tickets are left for each event, and how many have been sold.
You are also able to add new venues, add new events, modify existing venues, and modify existing events.
This website was created as a final project for CS50x.
